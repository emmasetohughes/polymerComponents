# polymerComponents
The purpose of this respository is to house a curated collection of polymer components used in Liquid Analytics products. 

After making changes to a component please commit your new version as other team members may need to reference your design in the future. 

Emma/Andrea will maintain the git repo but the team should feel free to contribute polymer components that they have used.
